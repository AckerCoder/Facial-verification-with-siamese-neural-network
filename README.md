# Siamese Neural Network Implementation for Face Verification

This repository contains an implementation of a **Siamese Neural Network (SNN)** using TensorFlow/Keras. The SNN is designed to compare pairs of images and predict their similarity, making it suitable for tasks like biometric recognition, image comparison, or verification.

## Features

- **Siamese Network Architecture**: Utilizes shared convolutional layers for feature extraction and a distance metric for comparison.
- **Custom Loss Function**: Implements contrastive loss for similarity learning.
- **Metrics Calculation**: Includes precision and recall as performance evaluation metrics.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides utilities to visualize input pairs and model predictions.
- **Model Saving and Reloading**: Supports saving the trained model in `.h5` format for future use.
